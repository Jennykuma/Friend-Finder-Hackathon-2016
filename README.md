# Friend Finder Android App for Hackathon 2016

An Android app developed in 72 hours for a Hitachi sponsored hackathon.

## Overview

Since many people have the opportunity to game, there are all kinds of players that you would come across.
Ranging from the beginner players all the way to the expert achiever, we're sure you have encountered these
players in games such as DotA, League of Legends and Counter Strike: Global Offensive.

The app seeks to solve a first world problem that we have thought:
> How can we play with other players that are that of my skill level?


The app does this by creating a framework where one would create a profile of himself which would be stored in a database.
Then, match ups are done by matching the skill level, play style and platform used. This would return a list of players with
their email address.

Future additions to this app would include a comment system and a rating system. These systems let other players know if a fellow player is good or bad to play with.
